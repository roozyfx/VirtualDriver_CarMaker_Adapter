The project is a minimal adapter that connects VirtualDriver via gRPC. The adapter sends ego vehicle state and receives control commands.
1) The adapter, implemented in SilCarMakerAdapter class, takes the address of the server and the id of the ego vehicle as input parameters, e.g. `SilCarMakerAdapter adapter("localhost:50051", 1);`
2) The adapter must be initialized first, don't forget this step or it will not work:`adapter.init()`
3) Next, set the ego vehicle at an initial location and reset its state via `adapter.testRunStart()`
4) In Each simulation loop, do the following in this order:
`adapter.writeOuputs();`
`adapter.readInputs();`
Updating the (mock) ego vehicle happens in 
`updateMockVehicle;`
in this simplistic, test case. 
`adapter.calc()` Does not do anything in current design, but it is recommended to keep it in your simulation.
5) Finally, when the simulation loop is finished, shutdown the connection to the server and perfom cleanup:
`adapter.testRunEnd();`
`adapter.cleanup();`


## Key Design decisions:
1) The SilCarMakerAdapter follows an Adapter design pattern, more specifically it is an object adapter.
So it derives from `MockCarMakerInterface` and stores an instance of `VirtualDriverService::Stub` as a data member.

The project is seen as a minimal, first step solution and for the future steps to extend and improve it. As a result:
2) Current implementation is a synchronous gRPC approach. It is chosen for its simplicity and easy logic. 
3) Current implemented Error handling approach is to write to std::cerr. There is clear room for improvement here and one of the obvious next steps. 
4) Following the _minimal working solution_ approach, there are some major problems with current implementation. For example, there are many hard-coded values, which as another next step improvement, should move to a configuration file.

## Assumptions made:
1) Server address is at localhost:50051
2) Initial state of the ego vehicle is set to:
pos_x(0.0)
pos_y(0.0)
velocity(0.0)
heading(0.0)
yaw_rate(0.0)
3) The simple, mock server used, only send fixed values for acceleration and steering.
4) The adapter waits for 3s to establish a connection to the server.
